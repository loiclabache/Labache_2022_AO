## Background

**Hemispheric specialization** is a fundamental feature of human brain
organization. However, it is not yet clear to what extent the
*lateralization of specific cognitive processes may be evident
throughout the broad functional architecture of cortex*. While the
majority of people exhibit left-hemispheric language dominance, a
substantial minority of the population shows reverse lateralization.
Using twin and family data from the Human Connectome Project, we provide
evidence that atypical **language dominance is associated with global
shifts in cortical organization**. Individuals with atypical language
organization exhibited corresponding hemispheric differences in the
macroscale functional gradients that situate discrete large-scale
networks along a continuous spectrum, extending from unimodal through
association territories. Analyses revealed that both language
lateralization and gradient asymmetries are, in part, driven by genetic
factors. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of the
origins and relationships linking population-level variability in
hemispheric specialization and global properties of cortical
organization.
